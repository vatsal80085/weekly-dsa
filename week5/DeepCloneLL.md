## Problem Statement: Deep Clone a Linked List with Random Pointer
The question asked by Snapchat

## Problem Description:
**Scenario:**
You are given a singly linked list where each node contains two pointers:
- `next`: Points to the next node in the list.
- `random`: Points to any node in the list (or `null`).

The task is to **create a deep copy** of this list. That means I should create a new list where:
- Each node is a **new object**.
- Each node has the same `val`, `next`, and `random` structure as the original.
- The cloned list must be completely independent (changes in the original do not affect the clone).

---

### Approach Used:
I Have solved this in **two main ways**:

1. **Using HashMap (O(N) space):**
   - Traverse the list and clone all nodes.
   - Store mapping: `original â†’ clone`.
   - Second pass: set `next` and `random` pointers using the map.

2. **O(1) Space (Interleaving Method):**
   - Insert cloned nodes between original nodes.
   - Assign random pointers using `original.random.next`.
   - Split the interleaved list into original + clone.

---

### Key Observations:
- The tricky part is handling the `random` pointers correctly.
- O(1) space approach is interview-friendly but slightly more complex.
- O(N) space HashMap approach is simpler and easier to explain.

        this.random = null;
